Most Icons Windows 10 uses are actually located in `C:\Windows\System32\`

The two primary locations are:

- `C:\Windows\System32\shell32.dll`
- `C:\Windows\System32\imageres.dll`

Plus a few in 
- `C:\Windows\System32\imagesp1.dll`
- `C:\Windows\System32\filemgmt.dll`

These locations are "Libraries" that are only accessible when using a "Change Icon" setting of some type...
