## sqlean - All the Missing SQLite Functions
- [nalgeon / sqlean](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlean) All the Missing SQLite Functions

A true gold mine on extentions to SQLite.

These are the most popular functions. They are tested, documented and organized into the domain modules with clear API.

Think of them as the extended standard library for SQLite:

- crypto: hashing, encoding and decoding data
- define: user-defined functions and dynamic sql
- fileio: read and write files
- fuzzy: fuzzy string matching and phonetics
- ipaddr: IP address manipulation
- math: math functions
- regexp: regular expressions
- stats: math statistics
- text: string functions
- unicode: Unicode support
- uuid: Universally Unique IDentifiers
- vsv: CSV files as virtual tables

The single-file sqlean bundle contains all extensions from the main set.
