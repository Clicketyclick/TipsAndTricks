## Putty

### Load session from command line

Configure and save a session (Color, keep alive etc.) in Putty

Call directly from command line - or short cut:

```cmd
"C:\Program Files\PuTTY\putty.exe" -load "Session Name" -ssh user@serverurl -pw password
```

### Keep alive
   
- Open Putty
- In the menu on the left select `Connection`
- in the field for `Seconds between keepalives (0 to turn off)` enter a number like `30`
- In the menu on the left select `Session`
- select `Default Settings` in the `Saved Sessions` area
- click the <kbd>Save</kbd> button to the right.
