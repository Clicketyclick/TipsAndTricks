# Ansi codes in CMD

Windows 10+ supports ANSI code for coloring out put as a default.

However it is pretty grim to encode.

```batch
ECHO [^[92;40mBold green on black^[0m]>CON:
```
Which shold be:
1. Print "["
2. Turn on GREEN on BLACK background
3. Print "Bold green on black"
4. Turn color off
5. Print "["

And of cause you will have to remember the exact syntax, coding etc.

A better way is to encode the colors as numbers in `{{}}` and let a script do the encoding:

```
CALL ansi "[{{92;40}}Bold green on black{{0}}]"
```
This is much easier to remember!
